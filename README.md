*Starfighter* is a space flight-simulation game where you pilot your aircraft to defend against waves of enemies. At any given time, three enemies will be present on the level, attacking with missiles and cannons. You are equipped with your own missiles and cannons, a more agile aircraft, and stronger armor.

Your objective is to survive as long as possible while destroying as many enemies as you can. Each missile hit earns you 50 points, and cannon hits give you 40 points. Destroying an enemy grants an additional 100 points. Enemies can be taken down with either two missile hits or three cannon hits. Keep playing to test your skills and achieve the highest score.
