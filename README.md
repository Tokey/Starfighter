*Starfighter* is a space flight-simulation game where you pilot your aircraft to defend against waves of enemies. At any given time, three enemies will be present on the level, attacking with missiles and cannons. You are equipped with your own missiles and cannons, a more agile spacecraft, and stronger armor.

Your objective is to survive as long as possible while destroying as many enemies as possible. Each missile hit earns you 50 points, and cannon hits give you 40 points. Destroying an enemy grants an additional 100 points. Enemies can be taken down with either two missile hits or three cannon hits. Keep playing to test your skills and achieve the highest score.

You control your spacecraft using keyboard keys. Use the arrow keys to adjust roll and pitch, A and D for yaw, and W and S to manage the throttle. Press Space to fire missiles and Left Ctrl to fire the cannon.

For more precise control, you can use the Adafruit Circuit Playground. Tilting the device left or right adjusts the roll, while tilting it forward or backward controls the pitch of the spacecraft.
